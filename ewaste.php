							<div class="eco_normal-offers">
								<img src="images/e-waste2.jpg" class="mt-3 mb-3">
								<p class="text-justify">Electronic waste (e-waste) is a popular, informal name for electronic products nearing the end of their “useful life”. Electronic waste (e-waste) typically includes discarded computer monitors, motherboards, mobile phones and chargers, headphones, television sets, air conditioners and washing machines. According to the Global E-Waste Monitor 2017, India generates about 2 million tonnes (MT) of e-waste annually and ranks fifth among e-waste producing countries. In 2016-17, India treated only 0.036 MT of its e-waste. Mobile Phones, Computers, Laptops, televisions, Washing machines, and air conditioners are common waste electronic products that we manage to dismantle, refurbish and recycle.</p>

								<div>
									<h4 class="green-text">Generates new employment</h4>
									<p class="text-justify">Most of the electronic scrap is recyclable, electronics recycling can play a significant role in creating employment. This is because new organizations dealing with electronics recycling will form and existing firms will look to employ more people to recover recyclable materials. E-waste recycling creates new jobs for professional recyclers and creates a second market for the recycled materials.</p>

								<div>
									<h4>Preserve Natural Resources</h4>
									<p class="text-justify">We can reuse maximum materials from old electronics items. We can reuse them or used to make new products, thus reducing the need to create new raw materials, & thus saves environment. Minimizing e-waste also helps us to conserve resources and reduces the amount of energy we need to make these products; recycling parts within e-waste uses considerably less energy than creating new ones.</p>

										<h4>Supports the Community</h4>
										<p class="text-justify">Recycling old electronics plays an important role in the provision of refurbished products such as computers and mobile phones, which can be of great help to low-income families, schools, and not-for-profit organizations. It also helps individuals gain access to technology that they could not have otherwise afforded.</p>

										<h4 class="green-text">Helps Protect Health and the Environment</h4>
										<p class="text-justify">Most of the electronics items have toxic or hazardous materials such as mercury and lead, which can be harmful to the environment if disposed of in trashcans. Reusing and recycling electronics safely helps in keeping the hazardous materials from harming humans or the environment. Instead of keeping old electronics in the house or dumping them in landfills, recycling or reusing them is an appropriate option that should be supported by individuals and organizations. Considering the benefits of electronics recycling, it is very important that people in various parts around the world embrace this concept.</p>
